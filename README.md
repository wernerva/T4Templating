# T4Templating
T4 Templating is a powerfull tool that, when used correctly will speed up the delivery of code by making it possible to automatically 
generate code. That's the theory at least.

I've seen it being used but never wrote my own T$ template scripts. This is my attempt to remedy that situation.

It has to be said that Visual Studio's utter lack of built in tooling for writing T4 templates is truly bizarre. I cannot fathom why it 
has been left to third parties to create tooling.
